# Landscapes XL


Creating stunning, randomly generated landscapes to use as backgrounds for software development prompts or desktop wallpapers is simpler than you might think. All you need to do is utilize the following code:

	``__landscape/aio__``

This code will generate a variety of breathtaking landscapes for your creative needs. Enjoy!


## Requirements:

* [Dynamic Prompts](https://github.com/adieyal/sd-dynamic-prompts)
	* Start WebUI
	* goto "Extension"
	* then "Install from URL"
	* enter / paste: ``https://github.com/adieyal/sd-dynamic-prompts.git``
	* hit "Install"
	* Reload UI

# Installation:

Simply put the contained folder "landscape" into ``""WebUI_DIR""./extensions/sd-dynamic-prompts/wildcards/landscape``.

After that, just make sure that you hit that "Refresh Wildcards" button at the bottom of the "Wildcards Manager" tab.


## Usage:

Again, the most simple is:

	``__landscape/aio__``

While this already contains several variations of possible combinations, you can use a more specific apporach to achieve a specific style, by exluding certain files.

Available options are:
* landscape/terrain
* landscape/specials
* landscape/
* landscape/sky
* landscape/time
* landscape/weather
